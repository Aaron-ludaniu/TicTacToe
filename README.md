Tic Tac Toe

Project Overview

    Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. 
    The objective is to form a line of three matching symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, 
    or diagonally before your opponent does. This project provides a simple and interactive implementation of the game.
